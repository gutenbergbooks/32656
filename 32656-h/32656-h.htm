<h2>A LETTER from Mons. <i>de Cros</i>, &amp;c.</h2>


<p><i>My Lord</i>,</p>

<p>I have been informed of the Calumnies that Sir <i>W. T.</i> hath caused to
be Printed against me. I know very well that Sir <i>W.</i> is of great
Worth, and deserves well; and that he hath been a long time employed,
and that too upon important occasions; but I am as certain, that he
had but a small share in the Secrecy of the late King <i>Charles</i>'s
Designs in the greatest part of the Affairs, for which he was
employed, from 72, till 79, which is the main Subject of his Work.</p>

<p>This Consideration alone might not perhaps have given me the
curiosity, or at least, any great earnestness to read his Memoirs; and
I might have very well judged that I could draw from them no
sufficient light and insight for the discovery of so many Intrigues.</p>

<p>Nay besides, I might have doubted whether or
no these Memoirs might not have been his own
Panegyrick upon himself, and the diminution and
undervaluing of the real Worth and Glory of several
Persons of Quality, and distinguished by
their Merit; whose Fortune and Reputation Sir
<i>W. T.</i> hath so much envied: for I am particularly
acquainted with Sir <i>W</i>'s Pride. He looks upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>himself to have the greatest Reach, to be the
wisest and ablest Politician of his Time; and a
man may perceive abundance of Satyrical Reflexions
scattered here and there in his Work against
most illustrious Persons, and that he hath
stuffed his Memoirs with his own Praise, and
the fond over-weening Opinion he hath of himself.</p>

<p>Without doubt this is quite different from that
Sincerity and Modesty which reigns throughout
the Memoirs of <i>Villeroy</i>, in the Negotiations and
Transactions of <i>Jeanin</i>, in the Letters of Card.
<i>Dossat</i>, those mighty and truly eminent Persons,
esteemed as such by the greatest Princes of their
Age; and even still are to this day, by the ablest
Politicians, with much more Justice and Glory
than Sir <i>W</i>'s Book-Seller stiles him, <i>One of the
Greatest Men of this Age</i>. It had been Sir <i>W</i>'s duty
to have regulated himself according to their
most excellent Pattern.</p>

<p>I shall at present only quote one Passage, which
I accidentally light on at the first opening his Book,
whereby one may easily guess at the greatness of
his presumption; in a short time, <i>My Lord</i>, I shall
give you occasion to observe many others. <i>The
Negotiations</i>, saith he, <i>that I managed and transacted
at the</i> Hague, <i>at</i> Brussels, <i>at</i> Aix la Chapelle,
<i>which saved</i> Flanders <i>from the</i> French <i>Churches, in
68. made People believe I had some Credit and Reputation
amongst the</i> Spaniards, <i>as well as in</i> Holland.</p>

<p>'Twas a Piece of strange Ingratitude of the <i>Hollanders</i> and
<i>Spaniards</i>, as well as of his own dear Country-men, so much concern'd
for the preservation of <i>Flanders</i>, not to rear him a Statue, which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>he saith, some-where else, Mr. <i>Godolphin</i> had promised him. Could
Sir. <i>W. T.</i> have done any thing to deserve it more; or was there any
thing more worthy of Triumph than to have preserved <i>Flanders</i>, a
Country so important to the <i>Spaniard</i>, and the only Bulwark of
<i>Holland</i> and <i>England</i>? But Sir <i>W.</i> was apt to believe he could not
find any one who was better able to hammer out his own Glory than
himself; and he flattered himself with the Opinion that he should
erect himself as many Statues, as there are places in his Memoirs,
crouded with intolerable and ridiculous Vain-glory.</p>

<p>It was not the Negotiations, my Lord, that Sir <i>W.</i>
tells us he managed at the <i>Hague</i>, <i>Brussels</i>, and at <i>Aix
la Chappelle</i>, which saved <i>Flanders</i> from the hands of
the <i>French</i>, in 1668. The <i>French</i> published that they
were beholding to the most Christian Kings Moderation
for that Peace; who was willing to put a
stop to the progress and course of his victorious
Arms. But the truth of it is, they most justly ascribed
all the Merit, and all the Glory of the Peace,
and of the Triple League, to the generous resolution
and stedfastness of the States-General. They
made use, upon this occasion, of a Minister of State
far beyond Sir <i>W.</i> in Prudence, Experience, and Capacity,
one, who was in the Opinion even of his Enemies, the most able
Manager of Affairs of his Age.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake, my Lord, in this place,
strictly to examine Sir <i>W. Temple</i>'s <i>Memoirs</i>: I will
do it shortly if God spare me with Life; nay, and
I promise you a Volume of Remarks, at least, as
large as his Book.</p>

<p>If, like him, I had the Vanity to procure the printing
of Memoirs, during my life-time, I could now
have a fair pretence so to do, and without all que<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>stion
I should publish more just and solid ones than
his are. Not, that I have the presumption to judge
my self more capable to do it; but, in several places
he relates some things falsly, whereof I am much
better informed. The only Hero of my piece
shall be Truth, without Complaisance or Flattery;
without Passion, no not so much as against him: So
that I shall do him the satisfaction and kindness to
instruct him better, even touching divers Matters,
which he performed and executed, without knowing
so much as the reason why he was made to act so.</p>

<p>It is not likewise, because I have been one of the Council of the King
his Master; yet I have had the Happiness, during some Years, to
partake in the Confidence of a Minister of State, who was in several
important, weighty Occasions, as it were the <i>Primum Mobile</i> of that
Conduct and Management that surprized all the World. You know, my
Lord, what Credit he had, and of what nature his Intelligences were.
Sir <i>W.</i> may well imagine that I did not ill improve this able
Ministers Confidence, when Sir <i>W.</i> tells us, <i>That I had wholly
devoted my self to him</i>.</p>

<p>Men are not ignorant likewise, that oftentimes I
have had some access to the King's Ministers of State,
and even near to the King himself,; it did more especially
appear, in the business for which I took my Journey to <i>Nimeguen</i>; and
it would be a great shame that a Man <i>more cunning and subtil than
them all</i>, according to the King's own testimony, as Sir <i>W.</i> relates
it, should not have had (considering so much freedom of access and
easiness) the address and cunning to dive into the most hidden Springs
of Deliberations and Resolutions, wherein the <i>Swede</i> and my Master
had so great an Interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Be therefore assured, my Lord, that after my Death, nay perhaps,
whilst I am alive, if need require, and if I be obliged thereto, there
will appear some Memoirs, which will divulge some Matters the truth
whereof is still so carefully concealed, Sir <i>W.</i> doth ingeniously
confess that hitherto he was ignorant of them; He, who hath so much
quickness of Penetration, and seems to make us believe that he was the
King his Master's Confident.</p>

<p>You your self, my Lord, have often urged me to acquaint you with such
important Secrets, and of such great Consequence; and altho' I could
not possibly refuse, upon the account of that honour you do me to
afford me any share in your Favours, to let you have a glympse of one
part of what pass'd in one of the most important Negotiations of that
time; yet you had so much Generosity as not to take the advantage of
it you might have done, to the infallible ruine, as was believed, of a
Minister whom you take for one of your greatest Enemies; yet on this
occasion one could not well lay any thing to his charge, besides his
blind obedience to the Will of his Master.</p>

<p>The Truth of it is, I am not obliged to have the same Considerations
that with held me at that time, but yet I preserve a profound respect
for the Memory of the late King, and also a great respect for some
Persons, who are even at this time of the day so much concerned, that
I should hold my tongue, if it were not for that reason, it would be a
very easie matter for me, to make appear without any more adoe, how
basely Sir <i>W.</i> is mistaken in what he delivers concerning divers
Negotiations of <i>England</i>; and especially concerning my Journey to
<i>Nimeguen</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>My Design is not at all, my Lord, to write you a Letter full of
Invectives against Sir <i>W.</i> I shall not descend to the Particulars of
his Behaviour, and shall tell you no more of them at present, than
what is needful to let your self and every body else judge that I have
means in my hand to be revenged for the Injury he hath done me.</p>

<p>They will be without doubt more just Invectives, than those that he
fills his Book withal. He set upon me first. He writes out of a Spirit
of Revenge, with a great deal of Heat and Passion, and like a Man that
believ'd himself touch'd and wrong'd to the purpose. As for my part,
my Lord, I protest I write to you in cold Blood, I do so much scorn
the Injury that Sir <i>W.</i> affects to do me, that I should but laugh at
it, if my silence was not able to persuade you, and those persons
whose esteem of me doth do me so much honour, that I have but small
care of my reputation.</p>

<p>Sir <i>W.</i> hath shined a long time, 'tis true; but yet he hath borrowed
all his Splendour first of all from the protection of a Lord, whom he
betray'd at last, of whom he speaks too insolently in his Memoirs and
with abundance of Ingratitude; and then again he advanced himself by
the protection of certain other persons to whom he was devoted, to the
prejudice of his bounden Duty: <i>He did so well insinuate himself</i>
(that I may make use of the Terms he makes use of in speaking of me)
into the Favours and into the Confidence of those, near to whom it was
necessary for him to have access, that he might have been in a
capacity to render considerable Services to the King his Master, and
to his Country, if so be he had made better use of this advantage;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
but he kept it just after the same manner as he had got it; that is to
say, that he often came short of exact Faithfulness and Loyalty, which
a Minister of State is obliged to maintain inviolably even in the
least Matters, that doth plainly appear in his Memoirs.</p>

<p>The late King of England <i>perceived</i> it, and was so far convinced of
it, that he never made use of him in the last Commissions he committed
to his charge, to the States-General; but only out of Consideration of
the Acquaintance he had there, who made people conjecture that Sir
<i>W.</i> might have some Credit amongst the <i>Spaniards</i>, as well as in
<i>Holland</i>, as he himself assures us he had.</p>

<p>Neither was he employed, but only upon some Occasions, wherein one
would not employ a Man who was a Favourite of the Prince, or for whom
he had any value, or in whom he might confide; 'tis a Truth owned and
confess'd by Sir <i>W.</i> himself in his Memoirs; and a Man may judge of
it by the so opposite false steps, that he complains, they caused him
to make, and by all the things that were done contrary to the Measures
that he had taken, just as if the Court had had a mind to expose him.</p>

<p>Besides, the King slighted him after the Peace at <i>Nimeguen</i>, and laid
him aside, making very little use of him; it was not, what he would
make us believe, his love for his own ease, and his Indispositions of
body, that made him decline his Employments. Never did Man desire more
to have an hand in Affairs; he was removed by reason of the King's
secret dissatisfaction at his Services, by that Conduct and
Management, which in executing the King's Orders, when they were
contrary to his Opinion, and disliking to his Friends, smelt very much
like perfidi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ousness and Treachery, as may principally appear in
whatsoever he did for to evade and frustrate the King's Orders,
contained in the dispatch I left with him at the <i>Hague</i>, to
<i>Nimeguen</i>, for the conclusion of the Peace, by Order of his Majesty.</p>

<p>It is concerning this business that has made so great a noise for
which Sir <i>W.</i> takes occasion to reproach me, that I am going to
relate you some Particulars in the Reflections, that I am obliged to
make upon what he says concerning my self. Do not expect, my Lord,
that I should teach you here the true Cause of so extraordinary a
Resolution which so much surprized Sir <i>W.</i> with which Pensioner
<i>Fagel</i> was so much astonished, and which in Sirs <i>W</i>'s opinion did
entirely change the Fate of <i>Christendom</i>.</p>

<p>I should please him very much, if I should discover so important a
Secret, in which many persons in the late and present Reigns have been
concerned. I do not doubt but Sir <i>W.</i> extremely desires it; he knows
very well the greater knowledge of these Practices would perhaps raise
a great deal of trouble in the Parliament to some people, whose Ruine
he desires at the bottom of his Heart, being little concerned for the
reputation of the late King, and envious of the esteem of those that
protected him, and who have bestowed so many favours upon him.</p>

<p>As for my self at this Conjuncture, in which K. <i>William</i> endeavours
the repose of <i>Christendom</i>, and the Happiness of <i>England</i> with so
much Zeal and Glory, I will not stir up the envy and hatred which has
too much appeared in <i>England</i>; and, which may perhaps be a great
Obstacle to that Union which is so necessary to the happy Execution of
the Undertakings of this great Monarch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>There arrived, said Sir <i>W. at that time from</i> England, <i>one whose
name was</i> de Cros. I shall not stop, my Lord, upon this Term of
Contempt, <i>One called</i>; it is a very malicious Expression, in respect
of my self; the late King of <i>England</i> himself did me the Honour to
treat me in Passports, in his Letters, in his Commissions which he
charged me with: It is very impudent and rude to speak so of a Man,
who is of a good Family, who has had the honour of being employed for
almost twenty years, and whom a great Prince and a King have not
disdain'd to use as Councellor of State.</p>

<p><i>He was</i> (continues Sir <i>W.</i>) <i>a French Monk who had
lately quitted his Frock for a Petticoat</i>. Here is
a reproach which ill becomes an Ambassador
of a Monarch, who is Defender of the
Faith, and of the Protestant Religion; of one
who declared so openly at <i>Nimeguen</i>, that he
would have nothing to do with the Pope's <i>Nuncio</i>.
I do not know, my Lord, that it is a disgrace
to be a Monk; and much less, to have been
one formerly: There are indeed amongst them, as
well as amongst the rest of Mankind, some miserable
Wretches, of a mean Birth, and of a disorderly
and infamous Life; People of no use, without Honour,
and without Reputation: Sir <i>W.T.</i> thought,
without doubt, that I was of that Number; but
there are likewise several very famous for the
Sanctity of their Lives, of an extraordinary Merit,
and of the greatest Quality, Sons of Princes
and Kings, and Kings themselves, and Popes: But
if this sort of Life is not now, as formerly it was,
so certain a Character of a good and honest Man,
do's Sir <i>W.</i> think he can dishonour me, in reproaching
me for leaving a Profession which himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
thinks so contemptible, for a <i>Petticoat</i>?</p>

<p>It will not be material in this place to say how I was engaged therein
in my tender years. There is nothing more usual in <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>
and <i>Italy</i>, where ancient Houses do sacrifice a good part of their
Families in Monasteries; 'tis a Maxim, to say the truth, most cruel
and horrid.</p>

<p>Neither will I relate how, and after what manner I came out of it;
however, it was not for a Petticoat. I have remained several years
without so much as having any inclination to it; and it hath been
apparent that I have had much a-do, and was very much unresolved as to
this Choice.</p>

<p>There was too great advantage to throw off my Frock for the Petticoat
that I have taken, not to do it. It is a Petticoat of a Scotch Stuff,
and which hath been a greater Ornament, and done the Crown of
<i>England</i> more good than Sir <i>W.</i> himself; if he do not know it, the
History of <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i> in these late Times may inform
him. I shall enlarge no further, that I may not engage my self to
publish the Misfortunes and Disorders of Sir <i>W</i>'s Family; which, I
suppose would not be like a Gentleman. I have no reason that I know
of, to complain, neither of his Lady, nor his Son, nor of his
Daughters.</p>

<p>Besides, had I even cast off the Monk's Habit for a Petticoat, I
should have done no more than a great many worthy deserving Persons
have done; yea, some of the Pope's <i>Nuncio's</i>, Cardinals, Bishops,
Kings and Princesses too, who have quitted the Veil for the Breeches,
whose Posterity, I make no question is highly esteemed and reverenced
by Sir <i>W.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>I did so well insinuate my self</i>, saith Sir <i>W. into the Court of</i>
Sweden, <i>that I obtained from thence a Commission to be a kind of an
Agent in</i> England. That is very dirty. I have had the management of
Affairs and the Quality of Envoy, when Sir <i>W.</i> had no more than that
of an Agent or Resident at <i>Brussels</i>. I was Envoy at the Court of
<i>England</i> before ever I was in <i>Sweden</i>, or before ever I had any
acquaintance there.</p>

<p>I went the first time to <i>Sweden</i> just at that time
the late King of <i>England</i> sent me into <i>Sweden</i> and
<i>Denmark</i>, about the beginning of the Year 1676.
The Pretence was for to demand the free passage
of Letters; which the King of <i>Denmark</i> refused,
for hastening the Congress of <i>Nimeguen</i>, in procuring
the expedition of Passports, requisite to the
Ministers of State who were to compose the Assembly;
and also to urge the Departure of the Embassadors
belonging to those two Northern Crowns.
But now the true Cause was quite another Matter,
and of greater consequence; not for the King
of <i>England</i>, but indeed for another Potentate.&mdash;That
shall be made appear some time or other in
my Memoirs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p><p>Had I been a kind of a <i>Swedish</i> Agent, I should not have defended
myself in that Point; I should have held it as a great piece of
Honour, since it could not chuse but be very glorious and splendid, to
have the Affairs of so great a King, in such important Conjunctures as
those were, committed to ones charge and care; but at the very time
Sir <i>W.</i> speaks of, I was dignified with the Quality of Envoy
Extraordinary from the Duke of <i>Holstein Gottorp</i>, acknowledged and
received at the Court of <i>England</i> for such.</p>

<p>Sir <i>W.</i> knows that very well, there was sent
him divers Memoirs to <i>Nimeguen</i> whilst the Mediation
lasted, which I had delivered in at <i>London</i>,
concerning the re-setling my Master; but the Interest
and Concerns of this Prince were so indifferent
to him, that I was fain to beg of my Lord Treasurer
to recommend them more particularly to
Sir <i>Leoline Jenkyns</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, you may see Sir <i>W.T.</i> mentions in his
Memoirs all the Potentates that had any interest
in the Peace of <i>Nimeguen</i>, except the Duke of <i>Holstein
Gottorp</i>, notwithstanding he had two Ministers
at the Congress, and although <i>France</i> had stipulated
for his re-establishment in the second Article or
Condition of the Peace, such who shall peruse the
Memoirs of Sir <i>W</i> might be apt to think that the
Duke of <i>Holstein</i> was reckoned as no body in the
World, and that he had no part at all in what pass'd
in Christendoom, from the commencing of the
War in 1672, until the conclusion of the Peace
1679. But Thanks be to God Sir <i>W.</i> is not the
Steward of Glory and Immortality.</p>

<p>Sir <i>W.</i> therefore must have often read my Name
and Character in the Letters, and Orders of the
Court, and cannot have forgot that he came to
render me a Visit at my Lodgings, at such time
as he, by the King's Order, was to confer with me
upon what account Monsieur <i>Olivencrantz</i> might be
obliged to pass from <i>Nimeguen</i> into <i>England</i>. That
<i>Swedish</i> Embassador lodg'd at that time in my house.</p>

<p>'Tis true indeed, as the Interests of my Master
were inseparable from those of <i>Sweden</i>, I found
my self engaged to be very much concerned in the
Interests of that Crown in whatsoever might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
depend on my care: There was an Envoy extraordinary
from <i>Sweden</i> at <i>London</i>; and yet for all
that, the <i>Swedish</i> Ambassadors did me the Honour
to maintain a very regular Correspondence
by Letters with me: The King of <i>England</i> was
also graciously pleased to hear me in what concerned
the Affairs of the <i>Swede</i>, although I was no
otherwise authorized for it. Monsieur <i>Olivencrantz</i>,
his Voyage to <i>London</i> was contrived first
of all by the King and my self, without the least
medling or intervention of any one of his Ministers;
and then again in the Negotiation,
whereof my Voyage to <i>Nimeguen</i> was a Consequence,
the Restitution of <i>Sweden</i> was especially
insisted upon.</p>

<p>All this made many Men believe, that I was intrusted with the
Management of the Affairs of this Crown; and Monsieur <i>Van Beuninguen</i>
believed it so to be, in the Letter he writ to the Lords
States-General, which hath since been printed; where he speaks with so
much uncertainty concerning the Voyage I was about to make to
<i>Nimeguen</i>, and about this Negotiation, that it was evident it was a
very great Secret.</p>

<p><i>Since his being at</i> London, saith Sir <i>W.</i> speaking of me, <i>he hath
wholly devoted himself to Monsieur</i> Barillon, <i>the</i> French
<i>Ambassador, under pretence to act for the Interests of</i> Sweden.
Monsieur <i>Barillon</i> was not at that time in <i>London</i>, when I was sent
thither, he came not thither till a long time after; I found Monsieur
<i>le Marquis de Ruvigni</i> there, whom Monsieur <i>Courtin</i> succeeded; and
after that Monsieur <i>Barillon</i> came to take the place of Monsieur
<i>Courtin</i>.</p>

<p>I never devoted my self to this Ambassador, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> never had any
Correspondence or was in League with him prejudicial to my Duty. Nay,
it happened the King of <i>England</i> one day, having a design more
especially to take into Consideration the <i>Swedish</i> Interests,
Monsieur <i>de Barillon</i> diverted him from it; whether for fear lest a
particular Peace should be clapp'd up between the <i>Northern</i> Crowns,
or else out of Jealousie, that he might leave the Glory of the
Restitution of this Crown to the King his Master; and depriving it of
all other relief, might keep it in the mean time in a greater
dependance.</p>

<p>I was so much put to it, and fell out with Mr. <i>Barillon</i> so much
thereupon, that I did not so much as speak to him in 3 or 4 months;
nay, one day as the King was at Dinner I cast in his teeth what had
past in the presence of <i>Monsieur Wachmeister</i>, Envoy-Extraordinary
from the King of <i>Sweden</i>. I do not question but Monsieur
<i>Wachmeister</i> remembers it well enough; he is no less worthy to be
believed, than he is brave and undaunted.</p>

<p>And now after this manner I became all one with the Ambassador of
<i>France</i>. But yet I must confess that at such time as he stickled for
my Master's Interest and that of the <i>Swede</i>, I was intirely devoted
to him, thinking my self most happy that I was enabled to pay my most
humble Services to such a great Monarch, whose Subject I have the
honour to be, without failing in my Loyalty and Allegiance, which I
ought to pay him before all others whatsoever.</p>

<p>Whereupon, my Lord, I shall tell you one thing, in which <i>Monsieur</i> de
<i>Ruvigni</i>, at present Lord <i>Galloway</i>, cannot but agree with me, no,
nor <i>Monsieur Olivencrantz</i> neither. The departure of this Ambassador
for <i>England</i>, occasioned shrewd suspici<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ons both at <i>Nimeguen</i> and
<i>London</i> to the <i>French Ambassadors</i>. Monsieur <i>Barillon</i> was much
alarm'd at it, especially when he saw that Monsieur <i>Olivencrantz</i>
lodged at my House, and when he knew that I had offered a Project,
upon which I had the Honour sometimes to be in debate with my Lord
Treasurer, Monsieur <i>Barillon</i> put all in practice to sift him to the
bottom; nevertheless all the offers of this <i>French</i> Embassador proved
ineffectual, and wrought thing upon this Man; who, if a man would give
credit to Sir <i>W.T.</i> was intirely devoted to Mons. <i>Barillon</i>, and yet
Mons. <i>Barillon</i> found him not to be corrupted or bribed.</p>

<p>One would think, my lord, that Sir <i>W.T.</i> has a
mind to make Men believe, that I was only sent into
<i>Holland</i> to carry him a Dispatch from the Court;
for he is always harping upon this String, when he
mentions my Voyage: Yet please to take notice,
my Lord, That he confesseth that it was I, <i>who procured
this Dispatch</i>.</p>

<p>What means the King then, when he says, That
<i>I had been too cunning for them all</i>? There is not so
much Prudence and great Abilities required in a
<i>Courier</i>; it is sufficient that he be expeditious. But
this Message must needs have been Honourable, to
employ an Envoy extraordinary of one of the
greatest Princes of the Empire, except it be what
Sir <i>W.</i> hath been pleased to say, That I was so
much devoted to the King; yea, and to Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>
too, and so little tender of my Master's Dignity,
that I would comply with any Offices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>If I were a Courier or Messenger, Monsieur
<i>T.</i> hath at least done me a good Office, in representing
me to be, what I would not have the
Confidence to believe my self; namely, that I
was an able Messenger, a Courier of the Cabinet,
and very deep in the King's Trust and
Confidence. For before ever Monsieur <i>T.</i> spoke
of this Dispatch, which as he says, the Court
sent him, to be kept as a mighty Secret, <i>Pensioner</i>
Fagel, says he, <i>knew all the Contents, and was
quite stun'd at it</i>. Du Cross <i>had industriously informed
the Deputies of the Town</i>, (1 Copy from
Monsieur <i>T.</i>) <i>and had told them that the two Kings
were intirely agreed on the Conditions of Peace;
that he had carried Orders to Monsieur</i> T. <i>to go to</i>
Nimeguen, <i>and that at his Arrival there he would
find the Letters of my Lord</i> Sunderland, <i>the</i> English
<i>Ambassador, at</i> Paris, <i>with all the Articles as
they are concluded between the two Crowns</i>.</p>

<p>Here is, I acknowledge, a very expert Messenger,
very knowing in the Secret, and very
forward in the work, in 4 or 5 hours time, that
I had been at the <i>Hague</i>. Monsieur <i>T.</i> will be
much more stun'd than Monsieur <i>Fagel</i> was,
when he shall know hereafter what past at the
<i>Hague</i>, in that little time that I was there, not
having discovered what it really was, neither
then, nor since. It was most certainly, something
of greater importance than to tell the Deputies
of the Towns the Contents of the Dispatch,
with which I was intrusted. And Monsieur <i>T.</i>
will see cleerly one day, how far <i>this only incident
did change the Fate of</i> Christendome.</p>

<p><i>I pretend not</i>, adds Monsieur <i>T. to determine by</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<i>whose Means, and how</i> du Cross, <i>obtained this Dispatch</i>.
And a little lower, <i>All that I could learn
at Court, about this matter, was, that his Orders
were made up one morning, in an hours time, at
the Dutchess of</i> Portsmouths <i>apartment, by the intervention
of Monsieur</i> Barillon.</p>

<p>It's pity, that an <i>English</i> Ambassadour, that
all the King his Master's Council (if one can
believe it) that a Man, who if he had pleased
himself, might have been several times Secretary
of State, should be so little informed, I will not
say during his absence, while he remained at the
<i>Hague</i>, and at <i>Nimeguin</i>, but even since his return
into <i>England</i>, of what past there, and
chiefly in that very affair, wherein Monsieur
<i>T.</i> was more exercised than in any other Business
that he ever undertook.</p>

<p>But how he could be know it, since neither
the Duke of <i>York</i> nor my Lord Treasurer, nor
hardly the King himself (if we may believe
Monsieur <i>T.</i>) knew any thing of it; And <i>that
these Orders were made in one morning, in an
hours time, at the Dutchess of</i> Portsmouths <i>Apartment,
by the Interception of Monsieur</i> Barillon.</p>

<p>Observe now, if you please, my Lord, the
Malice of Monsieur <i>T.</i> in Relation to Monsieur
<i>Williamson</i>, on whom he would give in this
place, the Character of Perfidy, as he hath done
in diverse other parts of his Memoirs. Monsieur
<i>T.</i> ought to have had at least, some respect for
the King, whose Orders Monsieur <i>Williamson</i>
did Execute.</p>

<p><i>I never talkt of it</i>, says Monsieur <i>T. to the Secretary of State</i>
Williamson, as if he would lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> that he was sufficiently perswaded
that Monsieur <i>Williamson</i> was a Man altogether for <i>France</i>, and that
he was intirely devoted as well as my self, to Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>,
and that he was the Author of this Dispatch.</p>

<p>Is it not clear that Monsieur <i>T.</i> would make us
imagine that Monsieur the <i>Chevalier Williamson</i>,
Secretary of State, the <i>French</i> Ambassador, and the
Dutchess of <i>Portsmouth</i> promised these Orders. As
for me, tho' I had the Dispatch given me, yet he
does not accuse me openly in this place of bearing
any other part in this Affair, than only as a Messenger
entrusted with the Conveyance. And not only
so, but I never went to the Dutchess of <i>Portsmouths</i>
Lodgings, she having an irreconcilable aversion for
me, and I for her.</p>

<p>Can there be a greater absurdity than this? To endeavour to perswade
his Readers that the most important affair of that time, on which
depended (says Monsieur <i>T.</i>) <i>The Fate of Christendom was concluded
and made up, in one hours time, in the apartment of the Dutchess of</i>
Portsmouth, <i>by the Intervention of Monsieur</i> Barillon.</p>

<p>Monsieur <i>T.</i> is accustomed so little to spare the
King's Reputation, that he fears not on this occasion,
to prostitute it, in a strange manner. He does
not only charge him with partiality and connivance,
in suffering <i>Valentiennes</i>, <i>Cambray</i>, St. <i>Omer</i>, and
several other places in <i>Flanders</i>, to be taken, without
Murmur or Opposition; But the King of <i>England</i>
obliged as much as could be, in the Quality of
a Mediator, and more through the Interest of his
Kingdoms to procure the Repose of Christendom,
yet corrupted by the <i>French</i> Ambassadours, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Charms of a Mistress, Sacrifices all <i>Europe</i>, and
his own Estate, to a Power that is naturally an Enemy
to <i>England</i>. And this without Ceremony,
in an hours time, without the advice of his Council,
and hides himself in the Apartment of a Woman,
as if he was sensible that he went about an
action the most unworthy of the Majesty of a Prince,
and the most opposite to the Felicity of his People
that could be. For what other Construction can any
one make of what Monsieur <i>T.</i> says, and can
any man conclude, otherwise when he reads this
worthy passage in his Memoirs?</p>

<p>Certain it is, that this Dispatch was made up by
Monsieur <i>Williamson</i>, and by the Kings Order. And
since the King was pleased to avoid opening his
mind hereon to Monsieur <i>T.</i> giving him no other
answer, but that I had been <i>more cunning than all
of 'em</i>; Monsieur <i>T.</i> might possibly Address himself
to Monsieur <i>Williamson</i>, who, it may be, might
tell him, <i>by whose means, and how</i> Du Cross <i>had obtained
this Dispatch</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis plain that Monsieur <i>T.</i> despairs of penetrating
into this Affair; that he knows not where about he
is when he speaks of it; and that he only seeks to
blacken the Reputation of the King and his Ministers.
If the Peace of <i>Aix la Chapelle</i> is his Favourite,
because he hath the Vanity to believe it to be
intirely his own work; 'tis easie seen that the Peace
of <i>Nimeguen</i> is his Aversion, because he is ashamed
to have had so small a Part in it as he had, and that
the most glorious part of his Life is not to be found
in that Negotiation.</p>

<p>I would have this Complaisance for Monsieur <i>T.</i>
though he treats me so ill; I would, at least, in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
part, draw him out of this great incertainty, on
the subject of the Dispatch which I brought him.</p>

<p>He is deceived, when he imputes this Resolution
to the Intrigues and Perswasions of <i>France</i>. It was
neither managed, nor taken, nor dispatcht, at the
Dutchess of <i>Portsmouth</i>'s; nor was it by the means
or intervention of Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>. That Ambassadour
had no part in it, but on the very Instant
when the affair was concluding. He was not so
much as present at the Expedition, as he had not
been at any time at the Deliberations. The Marquiss
of <i>Ruvigny</i>, the Son, carryed the first News
to the King, his Master, the same day that I parted
for <i>Nimeguen</i>. Monsieur <i>Williamson</i> knew well what
was contained in the Dispatch to Monsieur <i>T.</i> in
which there was nothing very mysterious. But he
was never privy to the secret of the Negotiation, and
tho' he was present when I took my leave of the
King in Secretary <i>Coventry</i>'s Office, yet he was then
ignorant of the true subject of my Voyage, and
perhaps he never knew it.</p>

<p>The King was not at all precipitate, and the affair was not concluded
and dispatcht in an hours time. It was treated on, and deliberately
considered near Three weeks. There was time given to the Ambassadours
of <i>Swedeland</i> to resolve themselves, and make their Answer. The
King's design was doubtless aimed for the good of <i>Europe</i>, and the
publick tranquility, but in truth, he had not in his Eye, nor did he
certainly believe <i>that happy Fate of Christendome</i>, for which
Monsieur <i>T.</i> labours so earnestly in consort with some particular
Persons, Enemies to the State, Seditious, and Disturbers of the
Publick Repose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>But <i>the King said pleasantly</i>, adds Monsieur <i>T.</i>
<i>that the Rogue</i> (Coquin) du Cross <i>had outwitted
them all</i>. If Monsieur <i>T.</i> had not made the King
say this, and had said it himself, I might have applied
to him, with as much Justice as any man in the
World, these Verses which I have read somewhere,</p>

<p>Coquin, <i>he calls me, with mighty disdain</i>.</p>

<p>Doubtless, I should answer Monsieur <i>T.</i> thus,</p>

<p><i>Seek your</i> Coquins <i>elsewhere, you're one your self</i>, But
the Person of Kings is sacred. Besides, Can that be
an abuse, which is spoken <i>pleasantly</i>, without the
least design perhaps of offending. For <i>Coquin</i> is a
word which the Late King of <i>England</i> often used,
when he spoke of People for whom he had notwithstanding
Respect and Consideration. 'Tis true, he
used the word also very familiarly, when he was
angry, but at such times he spoke with indignation,
and not pleasantly.</p>

<p>The Parliament presented an Address to the King
(as Monsieur <i>T.</i> reports) in which they represented
the Progress of the <i>French</i> Arms, and desired him
to stop it before it became more dangerous to <i>England</i>,
and the other Neighbouring Countries. <i>Don
Bernard de Salinas</i> (continues Monsieur <i>T.</i>) said to
certain Members of the Commons, that this Address
had so exasperated the King, that he said
those who were the Authors of it were a Company
of <i>Coquins</i>.</p>

<p>I remembred at my Arrival in <i>England</i>, in 1675, before I was to go
into <i>France</i> in Quality of an Envoy, whither I acknowledge his most
Christian Majesty would not permit me to come, either because they had
informed him that I had embraced the Protestant Religion, or it may be
because the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> King of <i>France</i> would not receive his own Subjects, in
the Quality of Ministers of other Princes. It happened, I say, that
the King of <i>England</i> (to whom also I had a Commission) bid the
<i>Marquiss of Ruvigni</i>, one Evening, bring me to his Cabinet, and
himself come in with me.</p>

<p>The King enquired of me, at the first, what news I could tell him of
the Condition of the <i>Swedes</i> Army in <i>Pomerania</i>, through which I
past, and exprest much concern that the <i>Constable Wrangle</i>, not
minding to pass forward into the Empire (as Monsieur <i>T.</i> says) had
thereby different pretences, had attacked the Elector of <i>Branderburg</i>
as vigorously and with as much success as he could. I told the King
the reason, which concerns not my present subject to report here.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I having informed the King of the State of <i>Germany</i>, the
King believing that I was to pass into <i>France</i>, spoke to me in these
very words. <i>Monsieur, tell the King, my Brother, that it is much
against my mind that I have made Peace with these</i> Coquins, <i>the</i>
Hollanders, <i>Monsieur the Marquiss of</i> Ruvigny, <i>who stands here,
knows it well</i>.</p>

<p>Sometime before the making of this Peace, the
King talking with Monsieur <i>de Shrenborn</i> Envoy
from <i>Mayence</i>, told him also, in Relation to the
<i>Hollanders, In a little time, Monsieur, I will bring
these</i> Coquins <i>to Reason</i>. Monsieur <i>de Barillon</i> writ
to the Count <i>d' Avaux</i>, the <i>French</i> Ambassadour at
the <i>Hague</i>, certain Discourses which the King had
concerning the <i>Hollanders</i>. The Count <i>d' Avaux</i>
made use of this to encrease the just Suspitions of the
<i>Estates</i>. He carried the Letters of Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>,
to Monsieur <i>Fagel</i>. Whereupon, the <i>States</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
made a terrible Complaint, and the King of <i>England</i>
said on this Occasion to the Duke of <i>Lauderdale</i>,
that <i>Monsieur</i> Barillon, <i>and the Count</i> d' Avaux
<i>were</i> Coquins.</p>

<p>Had the King called me <i>Coquin</i>, seriously, I
ought not to think it any very strange thing; since
he hath treated in the same manner the most powerful
and wisest Republick of the World, to whom
he had so great Obligations; two Ambassadours of
his most Christian Majesty, of extraordinary merit,
and as honest Men as <i>France</i> ever had; and also the
greatest Lords of his own Kingdom who were Authors
of the Address which the Commons presented
him.</p>

<p>There is also this difference, that the King, speaking
of those Lords, those Ambassadours, and the
<i>Hollanders</i>, he called them <i>Coquins</i> in anger, but
when he spoke of me, he said it <i>pleasantly</i> (according
to Monsieur <i>T.</i>) <i>and that I was a cunning</i> Coquin,
<i>more cunning than the Duke of</i> York, <i>my Lord
Treasurer, the Secretary of State</i> Williamson, <i>and
even the King himself</i>.</p>

<p>Either I am much deceived, or all the Ministers
of the Confederates that were then at <i>London</i>, would
have been all <i>Coquins</i> at this rate, and Monsieur
<i>Temple</i> himself, and would have deceived those
who abused and deceived them. For besides,
there is more credit methinks on such like Occasions,
<i>to be a cunning Rogue</i>, and to pass for a more
able Man than the most able Ministers of State, than
to be the laughing-stock, and the Fool of a <i>Monk</i>
and a sort of Agent; Sir <i>William Temple</i>, and some
others, were truly so on this occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>But I would acquaint Sir <i>W. Temple</i> of what he
has not perhaps heard of, as he has done the like
to me, I do not invent it to revenge my self, and
if I would make use of falshoods, I might make
recourse to more heinous Affronts; the truth of
my Remarks upon his Memoirs, shall be my full
satisfaction. What I shall relate may be found in
my Letters upon that account to the Prince my
Master, and his Ministers: I took no particular
care to divulge it immediately to Mounsieur
<i>Barillon</i>, to whom I was so much devoted; were
he alive he might witness that as well as the
Aversion the King of <i>England</i> always bore to
Sir <i>W. Temple</i>; and the little Esteem he had of
him at bottom. Upon my return from <i>Nimeguen</i>
to <i>London</i>, I went immediately to Court, as soon
as I came there I meet Prince <i>Rupert</i>, who askt
me with a sterne Countenance if the Peace was
Concluded, I answered him in the Affirmative,
upon which he cryed out and said, <i>O Dissimulation</i>.
After having had the Honour to give his
Majesty an account of what was past, I told him of
the ill humour I perceived Sir <i>W. T.</i> to be in, and
what I knew of his neglect of his Majesties Orders;
The King seemed very angry with Sir <i>W</i>'s.
Proceedings, and said, <i>he was a very impertinent
R&mdash;&mdash; to find fault with my Commands</i>.</p>

<p>But if the late K. of <i>England</i>, did not approve of my Conduct in the
affairs of <i>Nimeguen</i>, which in effect he declared at first in Publick
not to be pleased with, in which he play'd his part to admiration: If
against his will, I had truly inform'd the several Deputies at the
<i>Hague</i>, how that the two Kings of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i> were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
intirely agreed upon Conditions of Peace; if this accident changed the
Destiny of <i>Christendom</i>, and what endeavours soever the English Court
had made, there were no ways to repair the Breach. If I was a Fool, a
peice of an Agent, or a Knave, How comes it that the King suffer'd me
to stay in <i>England</i> near a year? nay, as long as my Master thought
fit. Why was the King so civil to me? Why did he recompence me for my
Voyage from <i>Nimeguen</i>? Upon what account did the King bestow several
other Favours upon me? How comes it, that I haveing made a great
Entertainment and Fireworks, to shew my joy for the Re-establishment
of the Duke my Master to his Teritories, that the whole Court should
do me that Honour as to be present thereat?</p>

<p>It was not my quality of Envoy Extraordinary
of the Duke <i>de Gottorp</i>, that hindred the King to
express some kind of resentment against me, and
thereupon to bid me avoid the Kingdom. I
do well remember the King was just upon the
point of making Mounsieur <i>Van Beuningen</i> Ambassador
to the States General, to withdraw and
get him out of the Land, because he had got the
word <i>Connivance</i>, to be foisted into a Memorial
he presented to the King, for the recalling of
the English Forces, which bore Armes in <i>France</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don Barnard de Salinas</i> was the Spanish Envoy;
the King made much of him, yea and loved him for
the particular care he had in <i>Flanders</i> of the education
of the E. of <i>Plym.</i> one of the Ks. Sons, He did
nothing but report up and down, that the King
gave the Authors of the Address, presented to
his Majesty, by the House of Commons no better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
name than Rogues. The King had his liberty
to reject this Address, as indeed he did, and no
ways apprehended the Consequences of it at
that time; yet for all that, he banished <i>Don
Bern. de Salinas</i>, not in the least considering his
Character, nor the Kindness wherewith he had
always honoured this Minister; Yea and he Banished
him too, without any respect to the King
of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>But, for me who had abused and deceived the
D. of <i>York</i>, My Lord Treasurer, ay, and the
K. himself, who had overthrown all those fair and
vast Projects, which the Confederates had contrived
at <i>London</i> and <i>Nimeguen</i>; and Sir <i>W. T.</i>
at the <i>Hague</i>, which had disclosed the Kings dispatches,
a <i>master piece of Secrecy, who was the cause
of quite changing the Fate of Christendom</i>: for me,
I say, against whom the P. of <i>Orange</i> had written,
and caused to be written so many thundering
Letters, against whom all the Ministers of
the Confederates called for Vengeance; against
whom Sir <i>W. T.</i> levelled more of his endeavours
to destroy me than the Court did to repair this
Breach, and patch up the business, it lets me
alone, it does not make the least complaint to
the Duke my Master; the K. does me a great many
favours, and laughs in his Sleeve at the Surprise,
at the Sorrow, and Complaints of the Confederates,
and Sir <i>W. T.</i></p>

<p>After all that, can any body reasonably believe
that the K. of <i>England</i> might have lookt upon
me as <i>a Rogue</i>: And when he told Sir <i>W. T.</i>
after a droleing manner that I was a <i>Rogue and
had out witted them all</i>, may it not be probable,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that he had a mind to jeer him, and to make
him sensible that he was taken but for Fool? It
was very like so to be.</p>

<p>I have not gone about, My Lord, to say in
this place what I might say, to wipe of all those
scandalous impressions that Sir <i>W. T.</i> hath such a
desire to fasten upon me; I suppose I have given
your Lordship sufficiently to understand, that
what he hath been pleased to say upon this
Theme of me, proceeds from inveterate Spite
and Malice.</p>

<p>But, what way is there to get clear of one of
the most Haughty, and most Revengeful of men,
who in his Memoires falls foul upon the reputation
even of the greatest Minister, who casts aspersions
on the Duke of <i>Lauderdale</i>, that most
Zealous, and most Faithful Minister, that ever
the King was Master of; on My Lord <i>Arlington</i>
whom Sir <i>W.</i> is bound to respect as his Master,
who was his Benefactor, that raised him from
his sordid obscurity, and as it were from the
Dunghill, to bring him into play, This ingreatful
person forsooke him, that he might catch at the
shadow and appearance of mending his Fortune;
he would not have stuck to ruin My Lord <i>Arlington</i>
by base indirect means: This is no hard
matter to make out, even by Sir <i>W. T.</i> his own
Memoirs, but yet I am acquainted with some
particulars upon this Subject that make my hair
stand an end, nay, and I have not only learnt
them from My Lord <i>Arlingtons</i> own mouth, but
also from a noted Minister of those times.</p>

<p>What a piece of impudence to call in question
and tax the Principal Ministers, and the soberest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Magistrates of <i>Holland</i>, viz. Monsieur <i>de Beverning</i>,
Monsieur <i>Valknier</i> and others, generally
esteemed by every body. To arraign them, I
say, some for Avarice, others for Partiality, I
had almost said for betraying their Trust. But
above all, to give such disadvantagious representations
of the E. of <i>Rochester</i>, and of Sir <i>Leoline
Jenkyns</i>; that, it would have been all one if
he had said, that Sir <i>Leoline</i>, was a man of the
other World, a plain downright Ideot, void of
insight and Experience: And that <i>Law. Hyde</i>,
now E. of <i>Rochester</i>, was a Lord altogether unacquainted
with, and no ways fit for the imployment
the King gave him at <i>Nimeguen</i>; nevertheless,
Sir <i>Leoline</i> was made Secretary of State,
and no notice at all taken of Sir <i>W.</i></p>

<p>As for <i>Laurence Hyde</i>, Sir <i>W.</i> speaks first of
him, as if he were a Youth, that should have
been sent to the University, <i>I plainly perceive</i>,
saith he, <i>that the chief design of that Commission
was to introduce Mr.</i> Hyde <i>into this sort of employment,
and to let him understand the manner
how the men behave themselves in the
same</i>, then he adds, <i>He excused himself out of modesty,
to have any thing to do with any Conference,
and Compiling Dispatches</i>. Was it out of the respect
he owed to Sir <i>W. T.</i> or for want
of Capacity, that My Lord shewed so much modesty,
that he would neither make Dispatches,
nor meddle with Conferences, what, he who
had been ingaged already, as he was afterwards
in very important Affairs; who had been Embassadour
in the principal Courts of <i>Europe</i>, who
was chosen as Chief of the Embasie at <i>Nimeguen</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
one who in all respects is so far above Sir
<i>W.T.</i> for all these great qualities; yet My Lord,
affords Sir <i>W.</i> just as much <i>difference</i>, as a petty
Scholar does a famous Pedant. And to reward
him, Sir <i>W. T.</i> would make him pass in the
world, for an Embassadour that was but at best
his Scholar.</p>

<p>I make account to tell you, what Sir <i>W.</i> dare
not acknowledge. Mr. <i>Hyde</i>, being more subtile,
and of greater Abilities than Sir <i>W.</i> and
of that quality too, that was not to be exposed,
would not intermeddle in a Mediation, which was
like to suffer so gross Indignities, as the Mediation
of <i>England</i> suffered at the Treaty of <i>Nimeguen</i>.
One time or other I shall publish those
indignities in my Memoires, together with the
weakness, and tameness wherewith they were
content to suffer them.</p>

<p>But now, if Sir <i>W. T.</i> hath not spared such Illustrious
persons as these: No, not so much as
My Lord Treasurer, at present Marquis of <i>Caermarthen</i>,
laying something to his charge, whom
also he does not do that right and Justice, which
is due to so great a Minister of State, one of the
greatest Wits of the Age, for business; a person
so Loyal to the King his Master, that he sacrificed
himself for his sake; and after all, so
full of zeal for his Country, that he hath bethought
himself of all expedients, and hath
not feared to expose himself to peril and utter
undoing, that he might deliver it from the mischiefs
that threaten it; If Sir <i>Will.</i> hath not spared
the Kings person, whose Dignity and Reputation
he so often sacrifices, can I hope to escape
his foul mouthed Language.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Peradventure he had better have done something
else, &amp; something wiser; great Confident of
Princes and Ks. the sole preserver of <i>Flanders</i>, as
he is, than to have entred the list with <i>a Monk,
with a kind of an Agent, and with a cunning Knave</i>.
But his desire of revenge hath prevailed, he believes
himself cruelly wrong'd, and he is in the
right on't, for that at the <i>Hague</i> and at <i>Nimeguen</i>,
which he was confident would be the
Theatre of his Glory, they made him act a
disgraceful ridiculous part. He imagines I am
partly the cause of it, either because that my
Voyage to <i>Nimeguen</i> might have been the effect
of my Negotiation, which he might have gathered
by the Kings answer, or, because I might
have done nothing in <i>Holland</i>, but administer
cause of Suspicions and Umbrages, that hasten'd
on the Peace, in spite of his Teeth, and Reverst
the Treaty he had but lately concluded at the
<i>Hague</i>.</p>

<p>My Lord, If I be not mistaken, here is another
occasion of Sir <i>W.T.</i> being vext at me. There
was a Treaty a foot between <i>England</i> and <i>Spain</i>,
for which purpose Sir <i>W.</i> was employ'd without
any other design in reference to <i>England</i>, but to
abase the Parliament, and no other on the <i>Spaniards</i>
side, but only to add a little more reputation
to their Affairs. Now the Parliament got
nothing by it, and the greatest advantage accrued
to the Spaniard, who upon this occasion made
him really believe it, and so took him for a
Cully. A sad acknowledgment for having <i>alone
saved</i> Flanders <i>for</i> Spain! I ridiculed this Treaty,
I made observations thereon, that were publi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>shed
in <i>Holland</i>, and men judged that the observations
were well grounded: After that, and
after the business of <i>Nimeguen</i>, I was not to expect
any Encomiums from so unjust a person as
Sir <i>W. T.</i> but still he might have writ more
like a Gentleman, and have spoken of me without
ever loosing the respect which he owed to
my Master, without doing so great an injury in
my person, both to my Name, and Family
out of a merry humour, for in whatsoever
past, I performed the duty of a Minister, both
zealous and most faithful; Nay, and I did nothing
but even by concurrance and good likeing
of the King of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>I beseech you, My Lord, conserve for me
the honour of your gracious favour, and be
fully perswaded, that I shall be all my life long,
with much respect.</p>

<h3><small>AN</small><br />

ADVERTISEMENT,<br />

<small>Concerning the</small><br />

<big>Foregoing Letter.</big></h3>


<p><i>It is now some Months ago since the
Foreign Journals gave us to understand,
that</i> Mousieur de Cross, <i>the Ingenious
Author of the foregoing Treatise,
was meditating an Answer to Sir</i> William
Temple's <i>Memoirs. As nothing more
sensibly touches us, than to have our
Reputation wounded by those Persons whom
we never injured. We are not to admire
that our Author who thought himself
unjustly attacked in these</i> Memoirs, <i>took
the first opportunity to justifie his proceedings
to the World; and if he sometimes
falls out into severe or indecent
Language, it is to be remembred that he
was not the first Agressor, but that his
Adversary taught him the way. How
well</i> M. de Cross <i>has acquitted himself
in this Affair, I will by no means take
upon me to determine. Let the Reader,
without prejudice or partiality, consider
what both Parties say, and then let him
judge for himself.</i></p>

<p><i>When these</i> Memoirs <i>first appeared in
publick, I remember the</i> Criticks <i>in
Town were much divided in their Sentiments
about them; some found fault
with the Stile, as too luscious and affected;
others censured the Digressions,
as Foreign to the Business in hand, and
particularly the Story of Prince</i> Maurice's
<i>Parrot, that (to use Sir</i> William's <i>own
Expression</i>, p. 58.) spoke, and asked,
and answered common Questions,
like a reasonable Creature. <i>Lastly,
the Graver sort of</i> People <i>were scandalized
to see several Persons eminent
both for their Station and Quality, and
some of them still Living, treated with
so much Freedom, and with so little
Ceremony; adding, that the Author
every where appeared too full of himself,
which I find is the very Character,
which the</i> French <i>Relator of the Negotiation
at</i> Nimeguen, <i>has been pleased
to bestow upon him.</i></p>

<p><i>Indeed, as for the Language of the</i>
Memoirs, <i>a Man needs but turn over
half a dozen Pages to be convinced that
the first Objection is just and reasonable.
Every Leaf almost stands charged with</i>
Gallicisms, <i>more or less; and indeed
'tis odd enough to see a Man of Sir</i> William
Temples's <i>Constitution, who all
along declares such an invincible Aversion
to the</i> French <i>Nation, so fondly doting
upon their Expressions, even where
he had no necessity to use them.  But at
the same time, I confess, I am of opinion,
that his Digressions are not so
faulty, it being not amiss in a just History,
but especially in</i> Memoirs, <i>to relieve
a serious Scene, now and then,
with something that is diverting and
agreeable.  As for the last Objection, I
have nothing to say to it at present,
since it is not improbable but that the
following Book of</i> Monsieur de Cross
<i>may prevail with him to attempt his own
Justification.</i></p>
